# The Future of Search

## Introduction

The Dutch Umbraco Community has prepared a small demo that will be presented at the launch party on November 27, 2025. This demo explains the basics of search in Umbraco and demonstrates how the new Umbraco Search implementation works with various search providers. The demo showcases practical implementations and provides insights into the future of search functionality in Umbraco CMS.

## Umbraco Search - The Future of Search

Umbraco Search is the new search implementation for Umbraco CMS, designed to improve the search experience for both the backoffice and the frontend. This project is founded in the Umbraco RFC "The Future of Search" and will eventually replace the current search implementation in Umbraco, at the earliest starting from Umbraco v18.

### Background and Motivation

The project was started in an effort to improve the search experience in Umbraco. It provides a modern, flexible, and extensible search abstraction that supports multiple search providers.

### Current Status

Umbraco Search is currently in development and will eventually be released as an official and production ready add-on for Umbraco v16+. It will eventually replace the current search implementation in Umbraco, at the earliest starting from Umbraco v18.

### Compatibility

Umbraco Search is compatible with Umbraco v16 and beyond.
